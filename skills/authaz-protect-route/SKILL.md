name: authaz-protect-route
description: Use when gating an endpoint or page behind authentication after the initial Authaz setup is done. Adds the right framework primitive — middleware matcher, `withAuth`, `[Authorize]`, `useRequireUser` — without re-doing the install. Triggers on "protect this route", "make this page require login", "require auth", "gate endpoint".

# Protect a route

For when Authaz is already wired up and you just need to add another protected route. If Authaz isn't set up yet, run the matching `authaz-setup-*` skill first.

## Step 1 — Decide where the protection goes

| Where the user comes from | Where to enforce |
|---|---|
| Browser, full page navigation | **Server-side** (middleware, `[Authorize]`, `/api/auth/me` check) — never client-only |
| Browser, fetching from your API | Server-side on the API — the SPA can hint by hiding UI but cannot be the gate |
| Service-to-service (M2M) | API key or M2M access token check, not a user session |

A common mistake: gating a page with only a client-side hook. The hook redirects *after* the page loads — a user with the source can read the page's secrets in transit. **Always gate on the server too.**

## Step 2 — Pick the right `@authaz/react` primitive

Exported hooks/components from `@authaz/react` v2.2.2 (verified in `packages/react/src/index.tsx`):

| Export | Shape | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `useAuthaz()` | `{ user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, login(), logout(), ... }` | Most general — call from any component inside `<AuthazProvider>` |
| `useUser()` | `AuthazUser \| null` | You just want the user object |
| `useIsAuthenticated()` | `boolean` | Toggling UI on/off based on auth |
| `useIsLoading()` | `boolean` | Show a spinner while the session resolves |
| `useRequireAuth(opts?)` | `void` (side effect) | In a component that should be auth-only — auto-redirects to login |
| `useRequireUser(opts?)` | `AuthazUser \| null` (null while loading/pre-redirect) | Same as `useRequireAuth` *and* returns the user in one call — guard for `null` before use |
| `useLogin()` | `(returnTo?) => void` | Just the login trigger |
| `useLogout()` | `(returnTo?) => void` | Just the logout trigger |
| `<ProtectedRoute>` | Component | Wrap children that require auth |
| `<GuestRoute>` | Component | Wrap children that should hide when signed in (e.g., sign-up page) |

Both `useRequireAuth` and `useRequireUser` accept `{ redirectTo?: string }` to customize where to send an unauthenticated user.

## Step 3 — Apply the framework primitive

### Next.js (App Router) — client component

```tsx
"use client";
import { useRequireUser } from "@authaz/react";

export default function AdminPage() {
  const user = useRequireUser();      // null while loading or before the redirect fires
  if (!user) return <Loading />;
  return <h1>Admin — {user.email}</h1>;
}
```

For server-side checks (server components, route handlers), call the handler's `/api/auth/me` from the request to confirm the session — that's the supported path. There's no `@authaz/next` server helper beyond the route handler today.

### Hono

`@authaz/hono` already exports middleware for this — don't hand-roll an internal fetch to `/me`. Use `authMiddleware()` for a plain session check, or `createAuthMiddleware({...}).requireUser` if you also want the parsed user attached to the context:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { createAuthMiddleware } from "@authaz/hono";

const { requireUser } = createAuthMiddleware({
  authazDomain: process.env.AUTHAZ_IDENTITY_DOMAIN,
  apiKey: process.env.AUTHAZ_API_KEY!,
});

app.use("/api/protected/*", requireUser);
app.get("/api/protected/hello", (c) => {
  const user = c.get("user");
  return c.json({ message: "hi", user });
});
```

### React SPA — `beforeLoad` (TanStack Router)

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/admin")({
  beforeLoad: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/auth/me", { credentials: "include" });
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw redirect({ to: "/api/auth/login" });
    }
  },
  component: AdminPage,
});
```

If your data loads via `fetch("/api/admin", { credentials: "include" })`, that endpoint *must* be protected on the backend. Client-side gating alone is not security.

### ASP.NET Core

```csharp
app.MapGet("/admin", () => Results.Ok(new { ok = true }))
   .RequireAuthorization();
```

Or `[Authorize]` on a controller method. For role-based:

```csharp
.RequireAuthorization(policy => policy.RequireRole("admin"));
```

For permission checks beyond simple role membership, see `authaz-permission-check`.

## Step 4 — Verify

For each protected route:

1. **Anonymous request** — should 302 to login (page) or return 401 (API).
2. **Signed-in request** — should reach the handler.
3. **Wrong role / missing permission** — should return 403 (not 401).

If the protected route loads but auth was supposed to redirect, the matcher likely doesn't include the path. Double-check `middleware.ts` `matcher` (Next) or `app.use("*", ...)` ordering (Hono).

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't use the access token as a database key** to look up "is this user allowed". The token already proves identity; use the SDK's permission check (`authaz.authz.check` in JS, `authaz.Authorization.Permissions.CheckAsync` in .NET) for "allowed".
- **Don't mix client-only gating with server returns of protected data.** Either every request is server-validated, or you have a vulnerability.
- **Don't 301-redirect protected pages to login.** Use 302 (or `Results.Challenge()` in .NET) — 301s get cached and break login UX.
- **Don't strip the cookie's `SameSite` or `Secure` flags** to make local dev work — set up `localhost` HTTPS instead.
